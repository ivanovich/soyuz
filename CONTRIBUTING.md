# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

## General
Patches are entirely welcome, provided the remainder of this document is observed. Patches to make existing code comply with this document where it does not are especially welcome.

## Conduct
The codifying of conduct keeping is a task that repeatedly follows a rigid set of heuristics and erratic feedback. Nonetheless, some foundational principles are useful; however, per the above, this is a living document.

### Relevancy
All discussion and so actions within the community should be relevant to the goal of the community. This also helps unify, by being strictly focused.

### Consistency
Actions taken within the community should be consistent with previous actions. This helps to dissuade strong actions without considering the effects.

### Privacy
Respect the privacy of others by leaving them be outside of the context of the community. This helps to ensure the community doesn't choose an unreasonably large venue.

## Technical

### Formatting Conventions
* Tabs are to be used for indentation; spaces for alignment.
* Lines are to be kept to 76 characters in Erlang code, as this is the width that can reliably sustain four columns of code at a legible size at a width of 1920, or three at 1440.
  * For the purposes of this guideline, tabs count for four spaces.
  * Naturally, this is all within reason. Embedding of raw text over 76 lines and other discretionary exceptions are fine.
  * There is no such width restriction for documentation, HTML templates, et cetera, as the former lend themselves well to line wrap, and the latter is in the interest of an understandable connection to the template's rendered output.

### Otherwise
Barring the above, this document defers to the official [Erlang Programming Rules and Conventions](http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml).
