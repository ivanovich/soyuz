devlog! this file doesn't really expire or delete entries between
commits, it's not exactly a changelog, but should help someone looking
at the codebase to get inside the developer's head if need be

since last update, the damn thing actually works!
in a most basic sense, anyway
hence the tongue-in-cheek commit message that this is watershed
the priorities going forward are, in order:
- input validation:
  - basic field length stuff
  - forced anon enforcement
  - any other parameters described in app config
  - basic post parsing for reply links and whatnot, a consistent
    representation post-parse
    - done in a manner that will lend itself well to later addition of
      full-blown wakamark support
  - tripcodes
    - utf8 to sjis, rip a table from icu, mechanically turn it into a
      binary, use binary:at, gucci gang
- another cleanup pass at the codebase
  - try to consolidate any routines that access state as tightly
    as possible, nest or merge any sequences of multiple mnesia
    transactions and try to make any individual request or response use
    one and only one mnesia read, one and only one application env
    (ets under the hood) read
  - if done right this will not sacrifice clarity or performance
- full page generation, subback, etc

once that is done, we can finally begin work on the actual important
part of the project, but let's not put the cart in front of the horse

okay, i've gone in and created proper configuration management
now i can:
- do up the html templates with the pertinent config items
- go back into the mid-level mnesia operations and make them feature-complete
- then i can feel safe and secure implementing good old proper page service

have some graphviz:
soyuz_config -> soyuz_db -> soyuz_read
soyuz_config -> soyuz_read
